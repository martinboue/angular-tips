## Vocabulary

Each tip describes either a good or bad practice, and all follow the same rule, as described in the official [Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/style-guide#style-vocabulary):

>**Do** is one that should always be followed. Always might be a bit too strong of a word. Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare. On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a Do guideline.
>
>**Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Aim to be consistent.
>
>**Avoid** indicates something you should *almost* never do. Code examples to avoid have an unmistakable red header."
>
>**Why?** Gives reasons for following the previous recommendations.
