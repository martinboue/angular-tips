# TODO
- general
    - file structure (shared/core/pages or features)
    - naming convention
        - Always use whole word, no abbreviation
    - code style
        - https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines
        - always use triple equal ===, except for != null
        - comments (bad vs good comment)
            - TODO and FIXME : always set issue/ticket code
    - never use var, use const or let
    - use #myVar for private var, not private myVar or _myVar
    - philosphy 
        - frontend should be as simple as possible, complexity must be on backend
        - data validation and business logic must always be on backend side, front side is for UX
        - use as little dependencies as possible
        - automate everything
        - KISS
        - SOLID
        - Prefer composition over extension
- data fetching
    - use resolver instead of ngOnInit data fetching
    - use OpenAPI specification
    - use specific models
        - prefix by Create/Read/Update/Search
        - suffix by Request/Response
    - REST API
        - plural
        - kebab-case in path
        - avoid verb in path
        - specific DTO for each endpoint
            - prefix by Create/Read/Update/Search
            - suffix by Request/Response
    - use interceptor
    - make as few requests as possible
        - avoid requests in loops
    - avoid multiple requests to get the data you want
        - if you need to combine the result of 2 requests = design issue
    - avoid sequential requests
    - avoid filtering request result, example : getting a list for just one item
    - no HTTP call
- typing
    - prefer `?` type over undefined in methode inputs or objectƒ attributes
    - never use any, use unknown or generics
    - do not create class for pojo objects
    - recommend tsconfig options
    - use `Readonly<T>` or readonly T or "as const"
    - use satisfies
    - type vs interface
- strategy pattern for component
- routing
    - route path not hardcoded, define constants to reuse for nav
    - use lazy loading
    - naming convention
    - use custom data to pass static data to components
- form
    - Template vs ReactiveForm
    - always type
    - formControlName vs formControl / form.controls.a vs form.get('a') vs form.controls['a']
    - how to translate enums to readable text
    - how to use mat-select and reactive form to display a list of objects (id or object itself as option value ?)
    - how to reuse form for both edit and readonly page
    - how to split form in multiple components
    - use control value accessor for custom form fields
- i18n
    - use https://github.com/daniel-sc/ng-extract-i18n-merge
- state management
    - prefer sharing inputs by input/outputs, then service, then store/shared state
    - use shared state only to : cache data for reusing it, or share data between two or more components further apart in component tree
- component
    - naming selector
        - prefix app-
    - group components attributes (inject, input, output, constants, ...)
    - use input, output and host signals instead of @Input, @Ouput and @Host decorators
    - use model for input/ouput
    - use inject instead of constructor
    - avoid ngOnChanges
    - avoid manipulating DOM
    - never use ViewEncapsulation.None
    - ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default vs ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
        - Configurer pour mettre OnPush par défaut dans angular.json
    - avoid as much as possible detectChanges, usually means it is bad code/architecture
    - avoid as much as possible markForCheck, use signals instead
    - subscritions
        - when and when not to unsubscribe
        - use async pipes
        - use takeUntilDestroyed instead of saving subscription and unsubscribe in ngOnDestroy
    - rxjs ?
    - use standalone, never NgModule
    - component extending another component or directive
    - implement lifecycle interface (OnInit, OnDestroy, ...) if you define its methods
    - prefer template and CSS in a seperate file
        - exception : extremely short template (1-2 lines)
    - template
        - avoid function call in template
        - never make heavy compute in template 
        - use content projection
        - use adequat tags
            - `<a>` with routerLink for links, not button with router.navigateByUrl
            - button for clickable elements
        - use control flow
        - use layout components
        - use as few tags as possible
        - attribute binding : always use `[field]="value"` instead of `field="{{ value }}"`
            - exception : mixing variables and constants, ex : `class="prefix-{{ state }}"`
        - group related tags in code blocks and add comments for readability
- styling 
    - ngdeep usage
    - global css
    - overriding UI lib components
        - material specific override mixin
    - avoid using !important
    - class vs NgClass ?
    - use MediaMatcher to subscribe to window width changes
- libraries recommendations and advices
    - state management : ngrx
    - ui components :
        - material
        - primeng
        - ng zorro
        - spartan ui
        - avoid mixing multiple components libs
    - css :
        - tailwind
        - bootstrap
    - icon
    - font
    - testing (jest, ...)
    - date :
        - moment : deprecated 
- performance
    - nothing then virtual scroll or client pagination then backend pagination
    - rendering
        - when to use CSR vs SSR vs SSG
- features 
    - auth
        - recommend tool : angular auth oidc client
        - inject token by configuring openapi generator or use interceptor
    - logging
    - handling exceptions
- maintenance : use migration guide and schematics
- abstraction
    - never polluting generic components with specific logic, use input/outputs, generics, content projection
- IDE
    - setup for vscode or intelliJ (plugins, conf, ...)
- testing
- going further, share useful links :
    - git commit convention
    - semver
