## About

Angular Tips documentation is intended for those who want to build complex industry web applications, with a large scope and codebase, designed to last over time and be developed and maintained by multiple people. 

It might not be suitable for simple web apps which can be simplified thanks to their smaller scope.

This guide is based on our experience of building a wide variety of applications with Angular.

You may not agree with everything, the important thing is to understand *what* you're doing and *why*.

## Angular version

This documentation assumes that you are using the **latest Angular version**.

> Support for multiple Angular version may come in the future.

## Vocabulary

Angular Tips uses the same vocabulary as described in the [official Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/style-guide#style-vocabulary):

>Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.
>
>The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.
>
>**Do** is one that should always be followed. Always might be a bit too strong of a word. Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare. On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a Do guideline.
>
>**Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Aim to be consistent.
>
>**Avoid** indicates something you should almost never do.
>
>**Why?** Gives reasons for following the previous recommendations.
