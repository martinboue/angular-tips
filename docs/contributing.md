## Rules :
- if possible, the tip title or category should be solution/problem/use case oriented, examples:
    - ❌ "::ng-deep" 
    - ✅ "Global style"
- a tip should add value to angular official doc
    - ❌ "Feature A exists" and A is documented on angular official doc
    - ✅ "To do X prefer using feature A over feature B because of Y"
- add a "Why?" detailed block for each tip.
