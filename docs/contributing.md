## Rules :
- if possible, the tip title or category should be solution/problem/use case oriented
    - good example : "Global style"
    - bad example : "::ng-deep" 
- a tip should add value to angular official doc
    - good example : "To do X prefer using feature A over feature B because of Y"
    - bad example : "Feature A exists" and A is documented on angular official doc
- add a "Why?" detailed block for each tip.
