# Notes
- code style: add "why?" sections
- avoid using switch default case with enums or union types (i.e. fixed set of values)
    - why? if you add a new case, the missing case will be detected by the compiler unless you have a default case
- seperation of concern (the art of creating reusable components)
    - abstraction techniques
        - never polluting generic components with specific logic, use input/outputs, generics, content projection
- use custom data in route to pass static data to components
- strategy pattern for component
    - routing vs if/switch vs NgComponentOutlet/ViewContainerRef
- auth
    - recommend tools : angular auth oidc client
    - where to store token?
        - cookie (httpOnly)
            - pros: propagates to downloaded files with `<a download>` or `<img src>`
        - localStorage
        - sessionStorage
    - how to inject token in requests
    - openapi config?
- features 
    - dynamic page titles and meta tags
    - prevent user from leaving the page with unsaved changes
    - logging
    - http error handling: add interceptor example.

        - Protect routes
            - Verify user is authenticated (guard) 
            - Verify user has a given role (guard)
        - Hide UI elements (custom directive)
    - custom field with control value accessor
    - show app version in UI:
        - do NOT import package.json to display version
        - use postversion script
- maintenance : use migration guide and schematics
- dev workspace
    - IDE
        - setup for vscode or intelliJ (plugins, conf, ...)
        - prettier
        - linter
    - .gitignore
        - DO commit package-lock.json
        - use angular default .gitignore
    - angular devtools chrome extension
- testing
    - when to test and when not to test
    - unit testing
    - component testing
    - e2e testing
- template
    - use layout components
    - use content projection
    - ng container ?
    - ng template ?
    - use @let
    - @for: use @empty, $last and $first
    - passing array as input and change detection not triggered when adding or removing elements in array, you need to create a new array
- details or add external link on REST API principles
- form
    - how to translate enums to readable text
    - how to reuse form for both edit and readonly page
    - how to split form in multiple components
    - leverage grouping controls to disable/enable a group of controls, checking a validity, ...
- typing
    - use `?` for optional properties or method inputs
    - use `Readonly<T>` or readonly T or "as const"
    - use satisfies
    - type vs interface
    - protected
    - type inference
- when to use and not to use Angular
- JavaScript details
    - false/true vs truthy/falsy
    - spread operator on list or object: `...myVar`
- component
    - use angular cli
        - short: ng g c my-comp
    - use standalone, never NgModule
    - component extending another component or directive
    - use host, view and viewChild signals instead of @Host, @View and @ViewChild decorator
    - contentChild and contentChildren
- dependency injection
    - overriding injection token
    - forwardRef
    - different injection tokens (useClass, useExisting, ...)

- tailwind css:
    - do not dynamically create classes (because detected at compile time)
- debugging
    - angular chrome devtools
    - json pipe
- add "Why?" to:
