# Getting started

## About
Angular Tips is a documentation intended to guide developers in building complex industry web applications, with a large scope and codebase, designed to last over time and be developed and maintained by many people.

It might *not* be suitable for simple web apps which can be simplified thanks to their smaller scope.

## Motivation

Angular is a powerful but complex framework that can be difficult to understand. It has evolved a lot over the years and will continue to do so.
This means there are often several ways of doing the same thing, good ways and bad ways, and traps you can easily fall into.

The goal of this site is to share the best practices and recommendations of Angular experts, to help you learn from their experiences and mistakes.

This guide will give you thoughtful opinions on Angular's features, you may not agree with everything, but the important thing is to understand *what* you're doing and *why*.

## Angular version

This documentation assumes that you are using the latest minor version of **Angular v19**.

:::note
Angular Tips follows the same major versioning as Angular itself, starting with v19.

If you're using an older version of Angular, we recommend you read Angular Tips v19. While many of the recommendations remain relevant, some may not be applicable to your specific version. Refer to the official [changelog](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases), [update guide](https://v19.angular.dev/update-guide) and [API reference](https://v19.angular.dev/api) to identify unstable and missing features.

## Vocabulary

Angular Tips uses the same vocabulary as described in the [official Angular documentation](https://v19.angular.dev/style-guide#style-vocabulary):

>Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.
>
>The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.
>
>**Do** is one that should always be followed. Always might be a bit too strong of a word. Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare. On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a Do guideline.
>
>**Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Aim to be consistent.
>
>**Avoid** indicates something you should almost never do.
>
>**Why?** Gives reasons for following the previous recommendations.
